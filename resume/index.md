  <h1>Resume</h1>
  <p>I'm good at understanding systems, be they human or technical. I love using data to understand the world, and helping others understand it too through great storytelling and visualization. I've run my own startup, built software tools, and simulated the energy use of all the buildings in the country.</p>

  <p>Check out my resume:</p>
