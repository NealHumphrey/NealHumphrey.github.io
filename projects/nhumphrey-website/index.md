NHumphrey.com
=============

To make this site I'm using:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple static website generator that lets you use templates and write content in Markdown without having to spin up a server to host your content management system. Github Pages rebuilds the site on a commit to the master branch.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), making the site mobile friendly and responsive, but with a few custom tweaks so that it's styled a bit more to my liking. 
- Thanks to Start Bootstrap for their [Simple Sidebar](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/) template, also customized. 
- Plain ol' HTML and CSS.
