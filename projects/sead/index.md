SEAD Street Lighting Tool
=========================

Picking the right street light is tough - lights can be tuned to have different intensity in every direction, and the right one varies by road width, pole spacing and height, pavement type and more. While working at CLASP, I designed and developed this software tool to make the process easier. It includes translation into 4 languages (En, Sp, Fr, Ru) and is required by the Mexican government for use in their street lighting incentive program. 

It's built in Excel, mostly with VBA, but don't be fooled - it does some heavy lifting. Oh how I wish that I could have coded it with a proper version control system though!

Check it on and download on the [SEAD Website](http://superefficient.org/sltool).
