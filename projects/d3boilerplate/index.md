D3 Boilerplate
================

D3 Boilerplate is a charting library for D3 that I spun out of work that I did with some collaborators on the Housing Insights projects. During that project, I wanted to find a system for reusable D3 charts that could make sure I started my charts out using a design pattern that encouraged the charts to be reusable and extendable. While I wanted to reuse the charts we made, more than this I wanted a solid foundation to start my code from so that I wasn't retyping or copy-pasting all the things that 'normal' charts needed. There are plenty of charting libraries out there for people that don't want to learn D3 and instead want to use pre-built graphs. D3 Boilerplate is for the the developer that wants to use D3 directly but wants to add structure to their chart code. 

I wrote [a blog post about the design decisions](/blog/2017/Reusable-D3-Charts/) of how the chart code is structured; it also has some more background on motivations for making a new library. I spun the project out of Housing Insights in August 2017 so the project is still in its infancy. You can check out the code [on Github](https://github.com/NealHumphrey/d3-boilerplate).
