Housing Insights
================

From September 2016 to September 2017 I have been the project manager and lead developer of the [Housing Insights](http://housinginsights.org) project. This open source civic tech project collects many of the open data sources that are relevant to affordable housing policy in DC and makes them available to policy makers and advocates in the form of an interactive web tool. The coding on the website is done by a group of volunteers at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org). Over the course of the project we had over 100 volunteers work on the project, with up to 20 at any given time. In addition to managing tasks for these volunteers and reviewing pull requests I also did a large portion of both the back end (Python) and front end (Javascript) code.
