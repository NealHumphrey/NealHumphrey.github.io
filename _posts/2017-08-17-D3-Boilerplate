### Core Principles

* The base chart should provide a fundamental design pattern that works for nearly all charts
* Charts should be able to build on each other, reusing code as much as possible
* There's no such thing as a one-off chart
* This is a library for people that want to use D3, not those that want to avoid learning it.
